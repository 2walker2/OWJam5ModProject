			ADONSONIA: I'm disappointed that this planet is so unremarkable. We can't even make it more interesting ourselves, since the ice is simply too unstable to build on.

			ALNUS: Subsurface scans indicate that the ice is hollow and that the planet possesses an ocean below it. If we could gain access to the area below the ice, we may be able to create structures.
