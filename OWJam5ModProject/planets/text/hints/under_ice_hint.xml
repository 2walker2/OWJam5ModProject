			ADONSONIA: I'm disappointed that this planet is so unremarkable. We can't even make it more interesting ourselves, since the ice is simply too unstable to build on.

			BETULA: I must agree, there really isn't much on this planet that we can work with.

			ALNUS: Subsurface scans indicate that there is a more solid surface under the ice, as well as a subsurface ocean. If we could gain access to that surface, we may be able to create structures.

			DAUCUS: The ice is quite thick, and would be very difficult to get through. Additionally, we'd have no guarantee that what we build wouldn't be covered with more ice after construction.

			ADONSONIA: Perhaps there's some way that the ice can be cleared away, if we have enough creativity.
