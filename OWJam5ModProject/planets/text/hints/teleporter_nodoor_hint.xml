			ALNUS: Who constructed this building around the warp receiver? I know we wanted one, but I can’t seem to locate the door.

			ADONSONIA: Would you look at that? It seems that I unintentionally forgot to put a door on the building. 100% accidental, I can assure you.

		<Text>
			ALNUS: Adonsonia, this is no time for your pranks! I left important materials and documents near the warp pad that I can no longer access! How do I get in!

			ADONSONIA: Who can say? Maybe there’s no way into the building at all. I suppose you’ll just need to figure it out.

		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<Text>
			ALNUS: Do you really expect me to believe that you don’t know any way inside when I can see your sap-treat wrappers inside? Wrappers which, I might remind you, are VERY RUDE to leave on the floor!
