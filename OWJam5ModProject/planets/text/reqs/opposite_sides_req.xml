		<ID>1</ID>
		<Text>
			BETULA: A concern that just occurred to me is the fact that, while we only have three possible orbits for planets to occupy, we have four total planets. Isn’t that a bit unrealistic?

		<ID>2</ID>
		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>
			ALNUS: That is a fair point. That is the setup that the teacher gave us, so perhaps we are meant to work with it in some way?
		</Text>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>3</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<Text>
			ADONSONIA: Perhaps it would be realistic as long as any planets in the same orbit are far away from each other? Being in the same orbit would have them move at the same speed, so they would never be able to collide.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>
			ALNUS: I believe that should work. I’ll let our teacher know that one of our requirements will be that any planets in the same orbit must be on opposite sides of the star.

			DAUCUS: A simple, elegant, and easy solution like that would be ideal.
