			ORYZA: I thought that you little ones would be interested to see this: directly above us lies a safe way to view the layers of the planet's core!

			ORYZA: Additionally, that door (at the end of the path behind you) is the final location that you will need to visit in order to submit your assignment. Think of it as your sixth requirement.

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>3</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
    <LocationA />
		<Text>
			ALNUS: I do have a concern with this. I'm fairly certain that other requirements of ours will make it impossible for us to use the stone and gain access to the core once we are ready to submit.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
    <LocationB />
		<Text>
			ORYZA: That is an interesting situation. Unfortunately, I simply cannot allow you to change your requirements at this stage of the project, and you will need to be here to submit your project. You all are very clever though, so I'm sure that you'll think of something!
