			ORYZA: I thought that you little ones would be interested to see this, a diagram of a planet's layers in the core of a planet!

		<ID>2</ID>
		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
    <LocationB />
		<Text>
			ORYZA: Additionally, this core is the final location that you will need to visit in order to submit your assignment. Think of it as your sixth requirement.

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>3</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
    <LocationA />
		<Text>
			ALNUS: I do have a concern with this. I'm fairly certain that other requirements of ours will make it impossible for us to use the stone and gain access to the core once we are ready to submit.

		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
    <LocationB />
		<Text>
			ORYZA: Hm, an interesting situation. Unfortunately I simply can't allow you to change your requirements that you set, and you will need to be here to complete your submission. You all are very clever though, so I'm sure that you'll think of something!
