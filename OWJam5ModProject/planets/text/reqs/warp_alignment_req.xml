			DAUCUS: A fairly simple requirement would be to have our transmitter line up with one of our receivers.

			ALNUS: I'm not clear on how that demonstrates an understanding of star systems.

		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<Text>
			DAUCUS: We've placed a number of different buildings on these planets, so it's already not a representation of a fully natural system. Given that, lining up the warp pads would demonstrate that we're considering how transport would work in the system.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>
			DAUCUS: Given that we only have the one transmitter, I think we can get away with lining up with whichever warp pad is most convenient.
		</Text>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>5</ID>
		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<Text>
			ALNUS: That is a fair justification. I'll let our teacher know that our third requirement will be an aligned transmitter-receiver pair.

			ADONSONIA: That's not a terribly natural requirement, Daucus. I'm surprised to hear that you're going against the grain like that. I like it!

			BETULA: I was skeptical at first, but I do like your reasoning. I vote that we make this a requirement.
