			ADONSONIA: An interesting idea for a requirement could be that one of the planets must havea large amount of solid ice on it.

			BETULA: That could be a good one! Star systems do tend to have a wide range of climates, so an icy body would demonstrate that.

			ADONSONIA: Alright! I've gone ahead and let Oryza know that we will include a planet with ice.

			ALNUS: Wait! Don't send that message yet! I was experimenting earlier and there doesn't seem to be a way to freeze water in this system! Our star is too hot to freeze the water, even in the furthest orbit.

		<Text>
			ADONSONIA: Urgh, I've already sent the message with the requirement. I'm sure that we can figure out some way to freeze the water, we just need to block the brunt of the star's heat from reaching the planet we want to freeze.
