			ADONSONIA: An interesting idea for a requirement could be that one of the planets must have solid ice on it.

			BETULA: That could be a good one! Star systems do tend to have a wide range of climates, and that would be fairly easy to implement since WATER_PLANET_NAME has a bunch of water on it.

			ADONSONIA: Alright! I've gone ahead and let Oryza know that we will include a planet with ice.

			ALNUS: Wait! Don't send that message yet! I was experimenting with WATER_PLANET_NAME earlier and there doesn't seem to be a way to freeze it! Our star is too hot to freeze the water, even at the maximum distance from the star.

		<Text>
			ADONSONIA: Urgh, I've already sent the message with the requirement. I'm sure that we can figure out some way to re-freeze the water, we just need to stop the brunt of the star's heat from reaching the planet.
