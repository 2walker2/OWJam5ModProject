			ADONSONIA: An interesting idea for our first requirement could be that one of the planets must have a large amount of solid ice on it.

			BETULA: That could be a good one! Star systems do tend to have a wide range of climates, so an icy body would demonstrate that.

			ADONSONIA: Alright! I've gone ahead and let Oryza know that our first requirement will be to include a planet with ice.

			ALNUS: Wait, don't send that message yet! I was experimenting earlier, and there doesn't seem to be a way to re-freeze water in this system! Our star is too hot to allow water to re-freeze, even in the furthest orbit.

			ADONSONIA: That's inconvenient â€” I've already sent the message with the requirement. Is there some way that we can further reduce the heat reaching the planet?
