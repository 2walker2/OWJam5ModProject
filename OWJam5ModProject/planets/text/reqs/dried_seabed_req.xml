			BETULA: I hope you all don't mind, but I sent Oryza the requirement that we would have a dried-out seabed on one of our planets. To help with this, I placed an ocean on one of the planets (which I have now named WATER_PLANET_NAME) so that it will have time to form a proper seabed.

			ADONSONIA: An interesting idea! Dried seabeds are fairly common in real star systems, so that should work well for this project.
